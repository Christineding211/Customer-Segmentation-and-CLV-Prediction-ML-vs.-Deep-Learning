## Title 
### Customer Segmentation and Customer Lifetime Value Prediction: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models in Retail

## Business Objectives
#### The objective is to develop and evaluate an effective approach for customer segmentation and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction in the retail sector. This Project aims to enhance CLV prediction by comparing the predictive accuracy of various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.

### Key Business Insights
- **Deep learning achieved the highest accuracy of 98.56%, outperforming Random Forest and XGBoost (95.6%)**.
- **Cluster 3 (high-value customers) showed the lowest recall in machine learning models, indicating difficulty in classifying this group. However, the MLP model addressed this challenge with a recall of 99% for Cluster 3, effectively capturing its patterns**.
